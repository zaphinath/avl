make BST -> AVL tree

store height

getHeight(Node n)
	if (n == null)
		return validheight
	else return n.height

	best way in tree is to make a recursive add 
	recAdd(Node where at, Node what addign)
		return a Node

		root = recAdd(root, o)

	Iterator return preorder
	make preorder array and go through
	or make toArray use iterator

	make node class as an inner class of my tree

	public class setImpl {
		add(   )
			Node n
			n.height

		private class Node {
			private int height;


	- balance method
	- 
	Node balance (Node n)
	left.height = -1
	right.height = 1

	- only way to iterate is with a stack
		put a root on the top of the stack

		recommended make another private class for the iterator
